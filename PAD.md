# Final Thoughts
Difficulty ramp is can vary as the certain leader cards are stronger than others and receiving cards through the egg machine is RNG. In-game currency can be aquired through the in-game mail from events as well as for the first time completing a dungeon. This is useful if the player wants to minimize or not use in-app-purchases at all.
