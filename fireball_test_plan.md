## Summary

Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape made of blocks of different materials. 
As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and can set fire to more and more different types of blocks. 
The fireball the player controls can also rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion.
