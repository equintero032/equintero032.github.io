Red Faction is a fun FPS with a fairly linear single-player mode and arena shooter multiplayer mode. Developed by Volition, Red Faction 
uses the Geo-Mod engine to allow players to alter the level using destructive means ranging from the remote charges to the 
selection of vehicles available in the game. There are several things that could be tested in this game.

The first thing that could be tested is a stress test of the engine. The Geo-Mod engine is what allows players to alter the environment. 
The alterations and physics interactions of certain structures collapsing in multiplayer as well as a large number of players 
in-game could have unintended consequences on the gameplay such as reduced frame rate or even cause it to crash. 
Making sure that the health and ammo pickups restore the proper amount in multiplayer and on different difficulties in single-player 
would be another thing to test to balance both modes. Testing the AI to make sure that enemies use cover and civilians hide or run for 
alarms when the player has a weapon out would be important as well. The game has a couple of stealth sections in the single-player and 
something to test would be the balance of those sections. For example, the player only has a disguise and a silenced pistol with 
two magazines for the entirety of each stealth section. If the player gets too close to the enemies then they see through the disguise, 
so detection ranges and patrol patterns would need to be tested and adjusted to balance these sections out.

These are a few of the aspects that could be looked at by a tester when playing Red Faction.
