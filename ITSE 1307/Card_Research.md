I would like to do Egyptian Ratscrew over Slapjack because they share the mechanic of needing to slap the cards on the table when a
condition is met, but there are more situations in which to win with Egyptian Ratscrew. They would keep track of the same things, such as
cards on the field and cards in each players possession after a win condition is met. The things to keep track of that would be different
are the types of win conditions.
