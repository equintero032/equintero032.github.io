# Final Thoughts
Advance Wars 2 is a great TBS that offers a significant challenge in overcoming certain missions. A Hard mode which is unlocked after beating the game once adds replayability along with unlocks for clearing it. Multiplayer is fun when playing either a human or AI opponent and the ability to create custom maps gives this game a lot of value.
