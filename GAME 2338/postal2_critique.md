# Final Thoughts
Overall Postal 2 is as fun as it was controversial at its release. A common problem that involves getting the character model stuck in some locations is quickly alleviated by a built-in system that detects if they player is stuck and teleports them to another spot nearby. Controls are nicely placed and don't interfere with gameplay flow much.
