# Final Thoughts
Massive Chalice is a game that offers a lot of replayability due to its mechanic of needing to replace units lost in combat by having 
other units have children and raise/train them. These children can have a variety of traits that will either help or hurt them in combat
and due to this offers many different team compositions when the traits of each of the games classes are thrown into the mix. Combat gets
progressively tougher as the years pass and can become extraordinarily difficult if the player has not researched enough. Enemy AI is
good and will attempt to gain the advantage by flanking.
